Setting the more-info and free-standing links
====================================================

The more-info link
===================
**DISCLAIMER** *The set up of the more-info link assumes that exists a online
version of your schools module handbook* **DISCLAIMER**

You only need to save the part of the URL that is the same for each module. The
part of the URL that is the same can be found in the :code:`settings.yml` file
under the option :code:`info`, the part that changes for each module (the
module-code.html part) is automatically added to the link.


The free-standing link
=======================
This link is found on the homepage of the website and should therefore be a link
to the page on the universities website that students will go to when they are
applying to see what the degree they want to do will be like.

You can the URL for this in the :code:`settings.yml` file under the option
:code:`free`.
